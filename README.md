# Fantasy Football Flask
Flask webpage that can compare fantasy football stats and recommend players to start

# Goals
What I plan to do with this app
* Build a webscraper that can read and store information for each team and player
* Build a web app to display a single player with stats from each week
* Give analysis on future game
  * Show strength of opponent against that position and stats from previous games
    * Offer to show more info such as:
      * How player played against opponent of similar or better strength
      * Injuries on team that may give/take targets/attempts/etc
      * Eventually display weather stats if possible
  * Compare multiple players for current week or rest of season
  * Connect to Fantasy league and find top players on the waiver to pick up
